# CitymakR-city

Hello! This is the repository of the CityMakR 3D viewer. To get this up and running follow these steps: 

1. Open your terminal inside the vitecity repository
2. Inside your terminal run: npm install
3. After installation, navigate to cityProj repository
4. Again, inside your terminal run: npm install
5. After installation, run: npm run dev.

After these 5 steps a new window should open with a 3D field and sky visible. This window will likely be on the localhost URL, but this does not make it possible to connect to the server. Instead, navigate to your IP adress in the URL ending with the numbers of the port. Example: localhost:3000 means port = 3000. Change it to (Your IP):3000 (p.e. 127.0.0.1:3000).
